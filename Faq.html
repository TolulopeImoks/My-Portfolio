Will you deliver the food to us?
Yes all of our food is delivered to you. A delivery fee will apply to your area. If you are too far out of our locality, our staff may need to cook the food onsite as the quality of the food may be affected by the long travel.

Finger foods, platters, morning teas, working lunches. Hot items are dropped of hot and ready to go. They are not meant to be kept warm so delivery time needs to be no more that 15-30 mins before you wish to serve the food. Cold platters can be delivered earlier and refrigerated.

For all other menus we can simply drop the food off ready to go and leave you to serve it.

1 x chef/team leader per 150 people
1 x wait staff per 40-50 people
Bar staff will depend on the style of your drinks service.
