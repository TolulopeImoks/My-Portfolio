            <h4 class="about-h4">Welcome to Smart Meals' Brand</h4>
            <p class="about-p"> We are a food brand and more, we ensure customer satisfaction at all time. We offer:
                1. Corporate Catering
                If you work in administration, you may have been tasked with ordering food for your office at some point.
                 The service of providing food for a company’s employees is referred to as corporate catering.   
                This kind of catering extends to a range of small and large gatherings — private office meetings,
                 employee trainings, regional events and more. Popular choices for business events are boxed lunches, 
                 dinner buffets and continental breakfasts. Per the company’s request, a catering business can provide 
                 corporate catering services on a regular basis or for one-time events.  
            </p>

                <p class="about-p">2. Wedding Catering
                    There’s no denying that food and drinks are a major part of a wedding, making wedding catering a
                     critical service to consider. It’s important to plan a menu that ties in with your wedding theme and 
                     the season while accommodating any special dietary needs of your guests. Hiring a wedding caterer
                      takes a considerable amount of stress off any couple as they plan out the other details of their 
                      wedding and it allows for amazing food and beverage options to make their special day even more
                       memorable.
                </p>
                <p class="about-p">  3. Indoor and Outdoor Event Catering
                    Life is full of exciting achievements and milestones that call for celebration — what better way 
                    to commemorate a special moment than with food? A social event caterer provides food and drinks for
                     birthday parties, holiday parties, graduation parties, retirement parties and other social events. 
                     Whether it’s a summertime barbecue or a Christmas party, a skilled catering company can fulfill the
                      needs of any seasonal celebration.
                    </p>
                     <p class="about-p"> 4. Small Chops and All Cake Types
                        When you attend a large public event such as a sports game or concert, you’ll more than likely find 
                        catered food such as hotdogs, burgers, nachos, fries and soft drinks. That kind of catering is known 
                        as concession catering. Because a concession caterer will be tasked with whipping up large amounts of 
                        food to accommodate big crowds, it’s crucial to hire a pro.</p>
