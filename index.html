        <h4 class="about-h4">Welcome to Smart Meals' Brand</h4>
        <p class="about-p"> We are a food brand and more, we ensure customer satisfaction at all time. We offer:
            1. Corporate Catering
            If you work in administration, you may have been tasked with ordering food for your office at some point.
             The service of providing food for a company’s employees is referred to as corporate catering.   
            This kind of catering extends to a range of small and large gatherings — private office meetings,
             employee trainings, regional events and more. Popular choices for business events are boxed lunches, 
             dinner buffets and continental breakfasts. Per the company’s request, a catering business can provide 
             corporate catering services on a regular basis or for one-time events.  
        </p>

            <p class="about-p">2. Wedding Catering
                There’s no denying that food and drinks are a major part of a wedding, making wedding catering a
                 critical service to consider. It’s important to plan a menu that ties in with your wedding theme and 
                 the season while accommodating any special dietary needs of your guests. Hiring a wedding caterer
                  takes a considerable amount of stress off any couple as they plan out the other details of their 
                  wedding and it allows for amazing food and beverage options to make their special day even more
                   memorable.
            </p>
            <p class="about-p">  3. Indoor and Outdoor Event Catering
                Life is full of exciting achievements and milestones that call for celebration — what better way 
                to commemorate a special moment than with food? A social event caterer provides food and drinks for
                 birthday parties, holiday parties, graduation parties, retirement parties and other social events. 
                 Whether it’s a summertime barbecue or a Christmas party, a skilled catering company can fulfill the
                  needs of any seasonal celebration.
                </p>
                 <p class="about-p"> 4. Small Chops and All Cake Types
                    When you attend a large public event such as a sports game or concert, you’ll more than likely find 
                    catered food such as hotdogs, burgers, nachos, fries and soft drinks. That kind of catering is known 
                    as concession catering. Because a concession caterer will be tasked with whipping up large amounts of 
                    food to accommodate big crowds, it’s crucial to hire a pro.</p>

            </p>
       
            <p class="faq-p">
               <strong>Question:</strong>How much food do I need to order?
               <br>
               <strong>Answer:</strong>This depends on a few factors including the occasion, time and duration of the function, whether the guests are big or small eaters and your budget.
       
               Most of our menus are priced per person and our experienced staff will work with you.
               
               Make sure you have the right amount and variety of food for your intended function.

             <p class="faq-p"> 
             <strong>Question:</strong>How soon do I need to book and give final numbers?
             <br>
             <strong>Answer:</strong>For buffet and service events, we require final numbers 12 days prior to the function. For platters and finger food drop off we require 7 days prior.
       
              We will do our best to accommodate any late/last minute bookings as we understand some things are not planned.
       
            </p>
            <p class="faq-p">
               <strong>Question:</strong>What if I need to cancel my booking?
               <br>
               <strong>Answer:</strong>If a cancelation is made less than 48 hours prior the customers may be liable for 100% of the catering cost. See our General Terms and Conditions for more info.
